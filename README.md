# Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the book "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz. The dataset contains information about the age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical costs of insurance beneficiaries.

## Dataset

### Columns

- **age**: Age of the primary beneficiary
- **sex**: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male)
- **bmi**: Body mass index (kg/m^2)
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance
- **smoker**: Smoking status
- **region**: Beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
